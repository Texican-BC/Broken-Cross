 Bretlandic: "Bretlandic"
 Bretlandic_religion_desc: "The Bretlandic church represents the belief of the people inhabiting the regions on the British Isles influenced by the Nordic colonizers. By 1444 in these Danelaw kingdoms, while the peasants are nearly all exclusively Christian, the nobility is still majority Norse. This long interaction between the two has certainly impacted the way the peasants worship: which saints they venerate and what feasts they celebrate. The Celts to the north and Chalcedonians to the south look upon these kingdoms with great distrust. (The decentralized nature of Bretlandic prevents conversions early on increase fervor to help convert provinces.)"
