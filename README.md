# Broken-Cross
The Moors have almost completely overrun Iberia and southern France; in southern Italy, Emirs have claimed the once great city of Rome for themselves; and in the east, the Byzantines have already breathed their last. Meanwhile in the north, the Vikings have reformed their faith and invaded Britain, pillaging and converting for the glory of Odin as they went. Christendom is shrinking quickly and the light of the western world is going out. Can you defend Christendom once more and repel the invaders in the name of Christ, or will you conquer Europe in the name of a new god?
